@abstract{Conference videos combine several feeds into a single coherent
movie. Producing such videos usually employs a lot of repetitive work with
so-called non-linear editors. Fortunately, the domain of non-linear video
editing naturally allows the injection of a functional-declarative
scripting language with which it is possible to reduce a lot of the
repetitive work. 

This pearl presents the design of a video production language as an
illustration of the Racket doctrine, which says that languages belong into
the arsenal of software developers in the same way as type classes and
functors. Additionally, the pearl explains how Racket's eco-system
facilitates the addition of a type system. Finally, the pearl includes a
brief evaluation of the usefulness of the language.}
