@title[#:tag "background"]{The State of Video Editing}

People use tools called non-linear video editors (NLVEs) to
compose video clips@cite[technique-of-video-editing]. In the
context of film production, @emph{non-linear} means not
destructive, the source videos do not slowly degrade in
quality during editing.@note{Digital editors achieve this
 result by operating on references to videos, rather than
 operating on the videos themselves.} A non-linear video
editor, shown in @figure-ref{nlve-demo}, is a graphical tool
with a @emph{ time line} comprised of @emph{ tracks}. Each
track is a time line of the video and contains video and
audio clips. All of these tracks exist on the same timeline,
and various transitions indicate how to @emph{ composite}
the clips---how they compose. Finally, the NLVE @emph{
 renders} the video by playing the tracks simultaneously and
applying any additional filters.

Professionals have developed tools and design patterns to
reduce the amount of repetitive manual labor in video
editing. They frequently develop so-called macros---a
scripted sequence of user interface elements---in languages
such as AppleScript@cite[applescript-hopl] for the tools they
use.@note{@applescript-use-url} Some professional tools,
such as Adobe Premiere, @note{@premiere-api-url} even
include an API to create plug-ins directly.

Extending tools in this fashion, however, has its limits.
Macros are extremely brittle and frequently break, even
within a single application. Using a tool's official plug-in
interface produces more robust software, but it is still
tied specifically to that tool.
Blender@cite[essential-blender] for example, is only
scriptable with a modified Python interpreter that runs when
Blender is launched.

An alternative approach to reducing boilerplate actions are
general purpose multimedia frameworks such as
GStreamer@note{@gstreamer-url} or the MLT
Framework.@note{@mlt-url} These frameworks are APIs for
C-like languages that provide data types for building and
rendering videos. The appeal of these frameworks is the
ability to create abstractions, such as functions, to handle
otherwise repetitive tasks. For example, a professional
using one of these frameworks can write a function to create
the video for a conference talk.

These frameworks are primarily used in two situations.
First, they make up the back-ends to
traditional NLVEs. For example, Shotcut@note{@shotcut-url}
uses MLT. Second, professionals
use these frameworks to batch process videos, particularly
when interactive development is not desired.

Professionals also use domain-specific languages for video
editing. These DSLs primarily fall into two categories: XML
based DSLs and scripting language based DSLs.

XML DSLs such as MLT XML and the now deprecated
SMIL@cite[smil-tr] offer a declarative language for
processing videos. The entire program is the video being
described. These languages generally do not have functions
or any other type of abstraction. Professionals tend not to
deal with these XML languages directly when video editing.
Rather, NLVEs use these languages to save video projects.

Scripting-based DSLs, such as AVISynth@note{@avisynth-url}
are also declarative, but have their own limitations. Unlike XML based languages, these DSLs
do have functions and other abstractions. However, they are
not robust enough for anything but simple tasks, having
ad-hoc grammars and little to no code reuse features. making
robust use of them even more difficult. AVISynth, for
example, allows programmers to create simple functions, but
lacks control flow constructs such as conditional branching.
