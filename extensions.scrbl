@figure["video-gui" @list{Mingling graphical NLVE widgets inside of Video scripts}]{
 @(scale (bitmap "res/video-gui.png") 0.4)}

Some videos are best expressed with a graphical NLVE, and the DrRacket
version for Video therefore comes with embedded NLVE widgets.  Unlike other
NLVEs with scriptable APIs, the NLVE widget is actually part of the
language. A developer may place an NLVE directly into a script. Best of
all, the embedded NLVE may include code snippets, which in turn can contain
yet another NLVE widget etc. See @figure-ref["video-gui"] for a screenshot
of the editor.

A reader may wonder why one would want such a ``turtles all the way down''
approach to a Video IDE. Consider the case where a hardware failure during
a talk prevents the capture of the speaker's screen. Fortunately, the
speaker may have a copy the slide deck as a PDF document. While the
captured video can still be recreated by using the slide deck, a decision
has to be made concerning the duration of each slide. If a plain-text Video
script were to use this method, it would inevitably contain a long list of
``magic numbers.'' Embedding NLVE widgets into the code explains these
``magic numbers'' to any future reader of the code and is thus a cleaner
way to solve the problem. @Figure-ref{playlist-sample} illustrates this
point with a simplistic example. The module with magic 
numbers is on the left; the right part of the figure shows how an embedded
NLVE explains the numbers directly.  

Graphical NLVEs are producers and are thus first-class
objects in Video. They can be bound to a variable, put in a
playlist, supplied to a multitrack, and so on. Integrating
the graphical and textual program in this manner allows
users to edit videos in the style that is relevant for the
task at hand. For example, the program in
@figure-ref["video-gui"] shows an implementation of the
@racket[conference-talk] function from
@secref{overview}, now implemented using NLVE widgets with embedded code
snippets.

Traditional NLVEs have several advantages over these
widgets.@note{We conjecture that these limitations are not
 fundamental to the concept of these widgets. However,
 testing that claim requires a significant amount of
 engineering compared to the rest of Video's implementation.}
NLVEs such as Premier have a cursor that tracks a notion of
``current time'', with a preview window that shows a low
resolution but real-time sample of the video at that
position. This feature enables high precision editing with
quick feedback.

Video relies on the Racket ecosystem and the DrRacket
environment to get the quick REPL like feedback needed for
video editing. As described in @secref{overview-rendering}
the @racket[preview] function shows a low-resolution (but
real time) preview video being edited. This function starts
the preview moments after it is called; it can additionally
be called from both the Racket REPL and any shell
environment. Developers using DrRacket can even use its
cursor as an indicator for where to preview.

The Racket ecosystem makes it possible to add NLVE support with only a
small amount of code. The editor itself plugs into the DrRacket programming
environment@cite[drscheme-jfp]. The editor itself is built on top of
Racket's graphical framework@cite[plt-tr3], which greatly facilitates such
work.  The entire editor is implemented in less than 800 lines of code. Of
this, approximately 700 lines are for the graphical editor itself, and 50
are for the integration with Video. These lines are not counted in the 2,400
lines for Video's implementation. The code implementing these NLVE widgets
is plain Racket code and therefore we omit details of the implementation.
