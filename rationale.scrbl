@title[#:tag "rationale"]{Dr Strangelove: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Racket}
@; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Racket doctrine@cite[manifesto] says that developers must at any point
feel empowered to easily create and deploy a new language. The emphasis on
language reflects the Racket team's deep embrace of the Sapir-Whorf
hypothesis. In the world of software, this hypothesis means that language
frames the developer's ability to understand a problem and articulate a
solution---at every stage in the development process.

Philosophically, Racket achieves this ideal with a radical emphasis on
linguistic reuse@cite[SK-PhD]. Technically, this reuse is enabled via
Racket's distinctive feature: a modular syntax system@cite[macros-icfp].
In this system, it is easy to import a linguistic construct as a
function; indeed the system blurs the distinction between languages and
libraries@cite[lal-pldi]. While a library module exports functions with a
related purpose, a language module provides the constructs of a programming
language.

In Racket, every module starts with a one-line language specification. For
example, @code{#lang racket/base}---pronounced ``hash lang
racket base''---tells Racket and a future reader that the module is
written in the @racketmodname[racket/base] language. Roughly speaking, the specified
language is the first import into the module. From an implementation
perspective, the language specification points to a file that provides a
language, approximately speaking, a suite of linguistic features and
run-time functions. A developer can thus edit a language @tt{L} in one
buffer of an IDE and an @tt{L} program in a second one. Any change to the
first is immediately visible in the second one, just by switching
focus. Hence language development in Racket suffers from no points of
friction.

Developing a new language typically starts from a base language, reusing as
many features as possible. From this base language, a Racket developer
creates a new language with some or all of the following actions:
@;
@itemlist[ 

@item{adding new linguistic constructs;}

@item{hiding linguistic constructs; and}

@item{re-interpreting linguistic constructs.}
]
For the last one, Racket developers heavily rely on linguistic
interposition points, that is, anchors in the syntax elaboration process
where a program may inject additional syntax transformations. Video
exploits all of the above, plus of course, the ability to
supply additional run-time primitives with a new language

Due to the ease of developing and installing languages in the Racket
ecosystem, language creation has become a critical ``warhead''
in the arsenal of software-engineering tools, of comparable status
as Haskell's type classes and ML's functors. When developers realize that
it is best to express themselves in the language of a domain, they do not
hesitate to develop a matching programming language. After all, domain
experts have developed this specialized jargon so that they can discuss
problems and solutions efficiently. 

The domain of video editing is a particularly well-suited domain for
illustrating the above points. While the evolution of the language follows
the standard path from a veneer for a C library to a full-fledged
language@cite[fowler], Racket smooths this path significantly and this
pearl demonstrates how.  Before we can describe Video and its
implementation, however, we need to survey the world of editing videos.
