We would like to thank the reviewers for the detailed suggestions on
polishing our submission into a 'gem'. In return, this response addresses
major shared concerns in the first 500 words and then replies to all
other questions. 

1. As the reviewers clearly realized, the pearl uses Video as a running
example to illustrate the idea of language-oriented programming (LOP) in
Racket. It is not a research result on creating a video-editing DSL.  In
particular, though we have used Video to produce the RacketCon '16 channel on
YouTube, the language definitely has its short-comings. For example, 
we would not currently recommend it for the direct-manipulation of videos.

That said, the paper should explain interactive capabilities that *are*
available in Video: real-time previews like those found in NLVEs, the
editing capabilities pf NLVE widgets, and the full REPL interactivity. We
will extend Section 7 to discuss these features.

2. The paper distinguishes between two parts of a programming language:
_linguistic constructs_ and _run-time primitives_. An example of the former
includes new syntax (e.g., list comprehension for creating playlists or
other binding forms) while the latter refers to explicit functions from the
prelude (e.g., `green`) or implicit capabilities (not for Video, but think
GC).

3. The revision of the paper will clarify that Video is *not* tied to
DrRacket or a specific video-rendering framework. First, while Video
programmers benefit from using DrRacket and its embedded NLVE widgets, they
can use any old editor to create Video programs if they don't need 
widget-based functionality. 

Second, the Video language is also independent of the rendering library. In
the early stages of Video's development, we switched between two renderers:
libmlt and gstreamer. We even considered writing a functional renderer
within Racket. In this sense, Video programs are more agnostic to specific
rendering libraries than any NLVEs. We will discuss this flexibility in the
revised paper. 

4. The reviewers point out a mismatch between the typing rules presented in
figure 8 and the implementations of typing rules in figure 9. Our revision
will add rules to figure 8 that describe the implementation in figure 9.
Additionally we will include some more sample bugs caught by the type
system.

5. Though a discussion of related work is not crucial in a functional
pearl, we wish to contrast Racket's LOP approach from the DSL approach of
other languages, e.g., Haskell. We will explain the differences in more
detail in the final version.  For example, an embedded DSL with a type
system like Haskell's definitely benefits from the Haskell approach and
should not be created in Racket. Similarly, developers interested in
creating a graphically-edited DSL might be better using one of the mature
language workbenches such as Spoofax.

Review #93A

> is there any way to get quick, REPL-style feedback?

Video inherits Racket's REPL and thus supports an this kind of workflow
with functions like `preview`. Even better, DrRacket directly supports
Video programming via a "Preview" button. A low-res preview starts quickly
and the current video is played in real-time, with standard playback
controls.

> What if I want to preview just the middle five seconds of my video?

Use the provided playback controls, or supply `preview with `#:start` and
`#:end` keywords to extract the clip you want to render.

> The figure 11 ... if we want to avoid a list of magic numbers ...

A human manually appends the slides together in the same fashion one
would do with an NLVE. Section 7 shows that using Video does not
prevent authors from editing videos with an NLVE when appropriate. And
not only can the result of the NLVE be put into the program, but a
programmer can embed NLVE itself into the program.

We will revise Section 7 to present details about the implementation of NLVE widgets.

> The discussion of the type system in section 6 seems a bit half-baked.

We will add rules in figure 8 to match the code in figure 9.

> The bottom of p.17 says "A type error is signaled ...

We will add an example to illustrate this error.

> p.3: "the ability to supply additional run-time primitives with a new
  language" -- how is this distinct from "new linguistic constructs" listed
  above? 

See above.

> p.3: "Using a tool's official plug-in...yields a plug-in that is tightly
  coupled with its tool" -- sure, but isn't Video tightly coupled with
  Racket? 

See above. 

> p.4, figure 1: When a playlist has `#:start` and `#:end` keyword
  arguments, does that mean start of first clip/end of last clip?  

The `#:start` and `#:end` keywords modify the behavior of a producer.
Adding it to a playlist treats the entire playlist like a producer. So
for example, the start position can be after the first clip. 

> p.5: "What is missing, is the audio part" -- why not include the audio part?

We intentionally omitted audio to simplify the example.

> p.9: Since multitracks play producers in parallel, what if they're
  different lengths?  I would imagine they'd start at the same time, but
  the image on this page makes it look otherwise. 

Each *track* starts playing at the same time. Authors insert `blank`s
to delay the start time of a track's producer. The length of a
multitrack is the length of its longest track, with implicit blanks
added at the end of every other track.

> p.13: The description beginning with "This auxiliary syntax
  transformer..." does not seem to quite match up with either of the two
  patterns in the `syntax-parse` in `video-begin` in Figure 6. 

`b1` is one of the expressions that belong with `body ...`

> p.13: "The last piece of the `begin` block is `code`."  Huh?

This is a typo. 

> p.14: "The syntax transformer for function bodies..." -- To what code is this paragraph referring?

We will add a "elided" to that sentence.

> p.15: "It errors if a bad input or output type passes through this
  interface." -- I didn't quite follow this.  What would a bad output type
  be?  Is NULL bad, or do you mean it errors if the result is *neither* a
  profile object nor NULL? 

In this case NULL is bad output `mlt-profile-init` throws an error.

> p.16: `cut-producer` appears here for the first time.  Should it have been introduced earlier?

Previously `#:start` and `#:end` were sufficient (and cleaner) ways to
cut producers. Its needed here to abstract over the specific producer
being cut.

> p.19: "Turnstile reuses Racket's lexical scoping to implement the type
  environment." I am not sure I understand.  Does this mean that lexical
  scoping somehow frees us from needing to write down a context in the
  conclusion of the typing rules? 

As explained in the prose (on page 19), a type rule only specifies new
bindings to add to the type envirnoment, analogous to `let`. Existing
bindings are propagated according to standard lexical scope behavior.

> p.19: "elaborating the lambda body `e` may generate additional side
  conditions, `new-Cs`..." So, `get-captured-Cs` is something provided by
  Turnstile? 

These are functions defined by the developer of the language, though their
definitions are not included in the paper. We will clarify the prose and
include short descriptions. 

> p.21, figure 11: It would be easier to understand this figure if the
  numbers in the NLVE widget on the right were in the same units as 10, 15,
  16, 16... on the left. 

We will fix this in the revised paper.

Review #93B

> emphasizes the importance of building water-tight abstractions, but this
  is not really demonstrated in the paper. 

Any abstraction created with syntax-parse, e.g., #%module-begin in figure
6, or the type rules in figure 9 (implicitly) enjoys these benefits. For
example, syntax errors are automatically reported at the level of source
syntax instead of the generated syntax. 

> does "video clip" include both video and audio? is an "audio clip"
  just a special instance of a "video clip"? 

A video clip may contain audio, but does not need to. You are correct
that an audio clip is just a special case of video clip that contains
only audio.
  
> what is the relationship between a "time line" and a "track"?  

A video only has one timeline, which is composed of several tracks
layered on top of each other. (You are correct in your understanding.)

> In fact, the notion of "track" seems to disappear as the paper goes on.

Multitracks are groups of tracks. Video breaks down the traditional
notion of one global timeline with one global sequence of tracks
playing in parallel. Instead, it makes these concepts local, and so
each producer in a multitrack is itself a track.

> "*Obviously* a screen displaying the result can play only a single track
  for video" this wasn't obvious to me, especially when it was said that
  audio tracks can be played together.  Both seem to me like just summing
  information, especially if video has alpha channels or something.

The 'or something' that is the key here. There are a lot of different
meanings that placing one track over another could take.  Should the colors
be added together, should one track be a mask for the other, should it
replace only one color in the first track with the contents of the second
track? All of these are valid compositions, and this is why a dedicated
compositor is required to say how they get put together. If none is
provided, Video assumes that you just wanted to place one track on top of
the other, with no fading. If there is an alpha channel in the track on top
it makes sense for the one underneath it to 'fade through'.

While audio also has many ways it can be combined, simply playing the
two streams at the same time is a reasonable thing to do. If the audio
signals are added together, both streams appear to come out of the
speaker at the same time.

> An apt analogy for sequential transitions is that they act like infix
  associative binary operators on producers, like addition and
  multiplication, except always in the context of a playlist.

This analogy is correct.

> "specify the coordinates of the top-left corner of the producer" which
  producer?  the first one?  the second one?  the resulting one?

The coordinates of the bottom producer, the one that the top one is
being placed on top of.

> Figure 6: On lines 15-17, does it matter that the export appears at the end?

No but it should not show up inside of a function body. This definition was
easiest way to make this point in the paper. 

> Is "this-syntax" a special keyword from syntax-parse?

Yes, it is analogous to "this" in OO programming.

> on line 24  why not "(exprs ... this-syntax)" so that you wouldn't
  need to reverse on line 14?

Great! This will clarify the example.

Review #93C

> One concern that came to mind during the explanation of the `#lang
  racket/base` syntax is: How does a programmer know _which_ language to
  base their DSL off of?

The choice of host language depends on the desired capabilities of the
DSL. It does require some exploration of the Racket ecosystem to know what
others have already created. For example a logic-programming DSL may want
to use `datalog` (like Datalog, including syntax) or `racklog` (like Prolog
but with parenthesize syntax) as the host. `#lang racket/base` includes the
"core" of Racket and makes sense as host for (mostly) functional DSLs.

> Do the authors feel that `Video` should supersede _all_ of these tools? I
  would be interested to know where the authors feel that their DSL falls
  short (if anywhere).

See above. In addition, Video currently does not do well with full-featured
films, say the Star Wars saga. 

> In section 4.2: "..., `clip`, incorporate traditional video files." And then
  contrasts `clip` with `image`. What incorporates audio? 

We will clarify that `clip` produces both video and audio producers.

> In section 4.5: What happens if composites of a `multitrack` are
  different lengths? 

Each *track* starts playing at the same time. Authors insert `blank`s
to delay the start time of a track's producer. The length of a
multitrack is the length of its longest track, with implicit blanks
added at the end of every other track.

> In section 4.7: Here the use of `get-property` is so that the watermark
  is the same length as the video, is this necessary (see last point)? If
  it is, why doesn't `blank` require it?

Both `image` and `blank` do not require a length. In both cases, if
length is omitted, the length of the resulting producer is 'as long as
needed'. Which is to say it will be long enough to fill the remainder
of its current multitrack.

> "The last piece of the `begin` block is `code`." Do you mean that last
  piece is `export`?  I'm confused, I don't see `code` anywhere in Figure
  6. 

Typo. 

> "The astute reader may wonder ...". Am I correct that this is not shown in
  Figure 7, though there would be nested `begin`s during an actual elaboration?

This is correct.

> In section 6.3, As with the earlier comment, the nature of `multitrack`
  intrigues me, I'm very curious to see the typing rule for that.

Unsurprisingly, the definition is somewhat long due to many supported options
but we will work to fit a summary into Figure 8 in the revised paper.

> It might be worth stating whether any custom graphics were required.

See above. 

The NLVE widgets were constructed from ordinary Racket GUI widgets. The
process of embedding these widgets into the IDE is sadly extremely
complicated (but not a part of LOP proper). 

> Is there no area where other DSL implementation techniques fare better than Racket's?

See above. 

===========================================================================
Review #93D

> (Those parentheses ...)

(I (don't (know (what (you (are (talking (about.))))))))

> I suggest, when introducing the 'multitrack' combinators, that the
  authors foreshadow the fact that you may want the tracks to have the same
  size.

Yes, authors must insert blanks to make them of the same length. 

> I would not be surprised if those programs used a simple declarative
  format that closely resembles their Video script. 

They do! This is discussed in Section 3.

> I'm not really sold on the benefit of using this kind of a
  language. Video editing I have done is very interactive: laying out
  clips, making small changes, and playing back the result to see how it
  worked.

See above. 

> you don't want to render the result before viewing since it takes so
  long; most video editors use a low-resolution mode to quickly preview
  changes.

See also above. Video indeed supports such a quick preview mode. There is a
`preview` button and function that lets you preview a clip at a low resolution
with playback controls. That, combined with `#:start` and `#:end` was a
mandatory requirement of Video, and without it we could not have edited the
RacketCon videos in a timely manner.

> I think a interesting use case is for live applications like gaming
  livestreams: they will record video from their computer but add elaborate
  overlays with subscriber information, space for advertisements, and maybe
  a face camera.

Video would indeed be useful for such a use case, and other short content
from websites such as Youtube and Twitch.

> All that said, the implementation seem technically fine. I probably
  wouldn't mind building a fleshed out interactive video editor on top of
  it. 

See section 7.
