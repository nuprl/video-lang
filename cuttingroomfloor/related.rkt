This differs from many other DSLs
that are written independently of any host language.
Normally, the syntax for these languages are cobbled
together using either low-level parsing tools or by directly
modifying the code that implements of an existing language.
The former option makes writing a robust language difficult,
while the latter option removes any possibility of composing
languages written in a similar fashion.
