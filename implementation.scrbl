@title[#:tag "implementation"]{The Fast and the Furious}

Using the Racket ecosystem allows developers to implement
languages quickly and easily. Furthermore, these languages
compose so that modules written in one language can easily
interact with modules in another. Best of all, the
implementation of one language may take advantage of other
languages. The upshot here is that implementing Video is as
simple as implementing video-specific pieces, while leaving
the general-purpose bits to Racket.

This section discusses how a developer can implement a DSL
in Racket (@secref["impl-create"]), with Video serving as
the running example (@secref["impl-video"]). Not only is
Video a Racket DSL, but part of the implementation of Video
is implemented using another DSL, one designed specifically
for implementing Video. (@secref["impl-ffi"]).

@section[#:tag "impl-create"]{Creating Languages, the Racket Way}

Resuming the train of thought from @secref["rationale"],
creating Racket DSLs simply means removing unwanted features
from some base language, adding new ones, and altering existing
features to match the semantics of the new domain.

Adding and removing features is simple because a language implementation is
a module like any other module in Racket. Language authors
create a module that defines the new features, export those
features, and do not export unwanted ones. They do this in
the same manner as a programmer augmenting the functionality
of a library via a wrapper module. In contrast,
modifying existing features requires a little more
work than that. Specifically the module must define the new
primitive with a different name in terms of the old
language and name that primitive on
export.

Imagine writing a language where variable reassignment
(using @racket[set!] syntax) logs a warning of its use. The
@racket[set!] provided by @racketmodname[racket/base]
provides the functionality for reassignment, while
@racket[log-warning] provides the logging functionality. The
language designer needs to define a new syntax, let's call it
@racket[warning:set!], that logs its use and performs the
assignment. From there, that developer needs to rename
@racket[warning:set!] to @racket[set!] when exporting the
language's primitives. This renaming makes the new
functionality available to anyone expecting @racket[set!] in
the new language. Here is the resulting implementation:

@racketmod[
 racket/base
 (provide (rename-out warning:set! set!)
          (except-out (all-from-out racket/base) set!))
 (define-syntax (warning:set! stx)
   (syntax-parse stx
     [(_ id val)
      #'(begin (log-warning "Warning, reassigning ~a" id)
               (set! id val))]))]

In addition to syntax extensions, Racket's syntax
system supports several interposition points that facilitate
language creation: @racket[#%app] for function application,
@racket[#%module-begin] for module boundaries, @racket[#%datum] for
literals, @racket[#%provide] for module exports, and so on.
The purpose of these points is to allow language authors to
alter the semantics of the relevant features without changing the surface syntax.
As an example, a developer can
use a strict @racket[#%app] to turn a language with
call-by-value semantics into one with call-by-need
semantics. The @racketmodname[lazy/racket] language uses
this interposition point to convert @racketmodname[racket],
a language that employs strict semantics, into an otherwise
equivalent language with lazy semantics. The @racket[#%app]
protocol works because the Racket compiler places the marker in
front of every function application. Thus, language authors
only need to implement their version of @racket[#%app] in
terms of an existing one. Using the pattern from above, lazy
application is implemented as:

@(nested (minipage @racketmod[
 racket/base
 (provide (rename-out #%lazy-app #%app)
          (excpet-out racket/base #%app))

 (define-syntax (#%lazy-app stx)
   (syntax-parse stx
     [(_ rater rand ...)
      #'(#%app (force rater) (lazy rand)  ...)]))]))

@exact{\vspace{0.2cm}}

When a programmer uses this new language, Racket inserts the
language's @racket[#%app] at call sites, in this case,
@racket[#%app]@superscript{lazy}. From there, Racket
resolves the renaming and expands @racket[#%lazy-app] into
@racket[#%app]@superscript{internal}. The resulting
expansion looks like:

@(nested (minipage @racketblock[
 (f a b c ...) @#,->text{compiles to} (@#,elem{@racket[#%app]@superscript{lazy}} f a b c ...)
               @#,->text{compiles to} (#%lazy-app f a b c ...)
               @#,->text{compiles to} (@#,elem{@racket[#%app]@superscript{internal}} (force f) (lazy a) (lazy b) (lazy c) ...)]))

@section[#:tag "impl-video"]{The Essence of Video}

Video's implementation is spread across several main
components: a surface syntax, a core library, and a
rendering layer. It consists of approximately 2,400 lines of
code. Of that, about 90 lines are specific to the surface
syntax, and 350 lines define the video-specific primitives
the language uses.@note{The remaining lines are for
 the FFI and renderer.} The latter are
implemented using standard functional programming
techniques. They only serve as a thin wrapper of functions
to Video's core data-types.

@; #%plain-lambda -> #%lambda-begin?

Surface syntax is where Video uses two of Racket's
interposition points, namely @racket[#%module-begin] and
@racket[#%plain-lambda]. These points enable developers to
define the semantics of the module-level and local function-level
scopes respectively. As with @racket[#%app], using these
forms enables language authors to reuse the syntax of an existing
language, while still being able to reinterpret both whole modules
and local pieces.

Similar to @racket[#%app], @racket[#%module-begin] gets
placed at the start of every module. This enables languages
authors to implemented reinterpret context sensitive
transofmrations. It is with @racket[#%module-begin] that
Video can lift definitions and collect expressions.

@Figure-ref["video-begin"] shows the implementation of
@racket[#%module-begin] for Video, written with Racket's
@racket[syntax-parse] system@cite[fortifying-jfp]. As
before, the syntax is defined with a different name,
@racket[#%video-module-begin] (line 6), and is renamed on
export (line 3). The implementation of
@racket[#%video-module-begin] expands to
@racket[video-begin], passing the @racket[vid] identifier
(line 9). The @racket[video-begin] syntax transformation
(lines 11-25) is responsible for lifting definitions and
accumulating expressions into a playlist.

As with @racket[#%video-module-begin], the definition for
@racket[video-begin] uses pattern matching. Lines 13 and 17
are the two pattern cases for the transformation, one for
when the module is empty, and a recursive case that handles
the first expression. First, the algorithm grabs the first
expression and expands it to a common language (line 18).
This common language is simply fully expanded Racket code,
and thus uses the same syntax across all DSLs. Next, the
transformation checks whether if the expanded code is a list
(lines 20 and 24), and if the first element of that list is
one of several recognized symbols (lines 21-22) e.g.
@racket[define] or @racket[provide]. If the first identifier
is recognized, then the transformation lifts it out of the
@racket[video-begin], and recursively calls itself without
the newly lifted expression (line 23). Otherwise, it is an
expression and gets collected into the @racket[exprs]
collection (line 25). Finally, once @racket[video-begin] has
traversed every piece of syntax (line 13), the
@racket[exprs] list contains all of the module's expressions
in reverse order. The code generated in response to this
pattern defines the given @racket[id] (which is generally
@racket[vid]) to the expressions bundled as a playlist and
provides the playlist (lines 14-16).

It is worth noting that @racket[video-begin] for function
scope differs only in the base case. Rather than defining
and providing an identifier for the resulting playlist, it
mainly returns the constructed playlist. The recursive
call (lines 7 through 17) remains the same.

@Figure-ref["mod-begin"] shows the syntax elaboration of a
module using the Video specific @racket[#%module-begin]
form. The expanding module describes the running conference
talk example. Here, @racket[#%module-begin]@superscript{
 video} is Video's variant, while
@racket[#%module-begin]@superscript{internal} is the one
provided by @racketmodname[racket]. As with all
interposition points, @racket[#%module-begin]@superscript{
 video} gets resolved to @racket[#%video-module-begin].

@section[#:tag "impl-ffi"]{Video, Behind the Scenes}

Video relies on a C library---the MLT Multimedia
Framework@note[mlt-url]---to perform the rendering of video
descriptions to files or streams.

As it turns out, the Racket doctrine actually applies
the step of adding bindings too. That is to say, because
the task of importing bindings manually is daunting, we created
make a DSL instead. For example, Video employs a
one-off DSL just for building its internal data structures.
The implementation of this DSL is small but eliminates so
much boilerplate code  that the entire implementation of the DSL in
combination with the actual back-end of Video is smaller
than an otherwise identical back-end that does not use a
DSL. Thus, creating the DSL reduces enough effort that it
offsets the cost of creating it, even though it is used
@bold{only once}.

The auxiliary DSL @TODO{rejects?} two forms:
@racket[define-mlt] and @racket[define-constructor]. The
first form introduces a small DSL that combines with the
Racket FFI to facilitate the import of bindings from MLT.
The second form, @racket[define-constructor], defines the
core data types for Video. Additionally, this form
cooperates with the renderer to convert these data types
into data that MLT understands.

  (style #f '())
  (list
   @para{The @racket[define-mlt] form is useful for hardening foreign
