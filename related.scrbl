@title[#:tag "related"]{The Related Suspects}

Two main principles guide the Racket Way of creating DSLs@cite[racket-workbench-challenge]:
@bold{reuse} and @bold{abstraction}.

Reusing existing language components greatly helps DSL @emph{creators}, who are
unlikely to be programming language researchers. As the old adage goes, ``don't
build languages from scratch'' @cite[hudak-dsl]. To aid reuse, Racket allows
componentwise interposition of every core form.

Like all programmers, DSL @emph{users} deserve
proper abstractions, that is, constructs that do not expose the reused
components. This is especially true for DSL users who are not members of
the programming-language research community. In other words,
host language details should not leak into uses of the DSL, including in error
messages. Racket's syntactic abstraction capabilities builds on the innovations
of its Scheme and Lisp roots, but these predecessors never cared about writing
true abstractions. At best, Lisp and Scheme programmers write low-level
validation code that clutters the implementation; more commonly, validation is
omitted, leaving Lisp and Scheme macros that resemble naive rewrite rules that
do not distinguish the DSL from the host language. Racket helps the creation of
robust linguistic abstractions with a declarative DSL for writing syntax
transformers. Instead of low-level validation code,
programmers write high-level specifications, which is compiled to produce error
messages in terms of the surface language.

Now contrast this with DSL construction in regular functional programming languages.
Some researchers@cite[deep-shallow-icfp] have tried to present an alternative
``deep'' vs ``shallow'' characterization of DSLs. This view seems to ignore
reuse and abstraction and thus seems removed from the original purpose of DSLs,
which is to help an ``end user'' solve a domain-specific
problem@cite[hudak-dsl]. Deep embeddings implement a DSL's AST as algebraic
datatype constructors. As a result, well-typed DSL terms are also well-typed
host terms. While this makes effective reuse of the host language's type
checker, this approach still falls short on reuse because it requires
implementing an evaluator from scratch. In addition, the deep embedding
approach requires advanced type system features@cite[gadt-popl gadt-icfp],
which often produce obscure error messages that compromise the abstractions of
the DSL.

The ``shallow'' approach uses standard functions to build the DSL
@cite[hudak-dsl] and thus both reuses the evaluator of the host and leverages
the abstraction power of functions and types to hide implementation
details. This approach has limited flexibility to deviate from and change
features of the host, however, since it does not consider syntactic abstraction
nor interposition of language features. In other words, programmers cannot
create @emph{new} abstractions. The ``finally tagless''
technique@cite[tagless-jfp] tries to improve on the shallow approach via a
clever encoding of types, but sacrifices reuse and abstraction altogether in
the process.
