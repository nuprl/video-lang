Two main principles guide the Racket Way@cite[racket-way flatt-acm] of creating
DSLs: @bold{reuse} and @bold{abstraction}.

Reusing existing language components greatly helps DSL @emph{creators}, who are
unlikely to be programming language researchers. As the old adage goes, ``don't
build languages from scratch'' @cite[hudak-dsl]. To aid reuse, Racket allows
componentwise interposition of every core form.

Like all programmers, DSL @emph{users} deserve proper abstractions, that is,
constructs that do not expose the reused components. This is especially true
for DSL users who are not members of the programming-language research
community. In other words, host language details should not leak into uses of
the DSL, including in error messages. Racket's syntactic abstraction
capabilities builds on the innovations of its Scheme and Lisp roots, but these
predecessors never cared about writing true abstractions. At best, Lisp and
Scheme programmers write low-level validation code that clutters the
implementation; more commonly, validation is omitted, leaving Lisp and Scheme
macros that resemble naive rewrite rules that do not distinguish the DSL from
the host language. Racket helps the creation of robust linguistic abstractions
with a declarative DSL for writing syntax transformers
@cite[fortifying-jfp]. Instead of low-level validation code, programmers write
high-level specifications, which is compiled to produce error messages in terms
of the surface language.

Researchers have studied DSLs for a long time and have developed various
alternative classifications for DSL construction strategies. In the functional
programming language community, some @cite[deep-shallow-icfp] distinguish DSLs
along ``deep'' vs ``shallow'' lines.
Deep embeddings implement a DSL's AST as algebraic datatype constructors. As a
result, well-typed DSL terms are also well-typed host terms. While this makes
effective reuse of the host language's type checker, this approach still falls
short on reuse because it requires implementing an evaluator from scratch. In
addition, the deep embedding approach requires advanced type system
features@cite[gadt-popl gadt-icfp], which often produce obscure error messages
that compromise the abstractions of the DSL.
The ``shallow'' approach uses standard functions to build DSLs @cite[hudak-dsl]
and thus both reuses the evaluator of the host and leverages the abstraction
power of functions and types to hide implementation details. This approach has
limited flexibility to deviate from and change features of the host, however,
since it does not consider syntactic abstraction nor interposition of language
features. In other words, programmers cannot create @emph{new}
abstractions. The ``finally tagless'' technique@cite[tagless-jfp] tries to
improve on the shallow approach via a clever encoding of types, but sacrifices
reuse and abstraction altogether in the process.

In general, the deep vs shallow distinction seems more of an academic analysis
and less focused on the pragmatics of DSL creation. Thus, it might not be so
useful for programmers who are weighing tradeoffs and trying to solve
domain-specific problems in the most effective manner. Some
industrial programmers @cite[fowler] view DSLs as either ``internal'' or
``external''. Internal DSLs focus on reuse and typically involve extending a
host language (thus they are also commonly called ``embedded'' DSLs). The
Racket approach creates internal DSLs. External DSLs, as exemplified by the
UNIX philosophy of ``little languages'' @cite[unix], are typically implemented
from scratch and thus require more effort but as a result are not constrainted
by any particular host language.

Racket may also be considered a ``language workbench'' @cite[language-workbench
racket-workbench-challenge], which describes a broad spectrum of tools and
framework for creating DSLs, as well as a large community of researchers and
developers. While workbenches tend to utilize GUI tools @cite[metaedit], as
opposed to Racket's programmatic and textual approach, and commonly create
external DSLs @cite[spoofax], some more closely resemble Racket's ``reuse and
abstraction'' approach @cite[sugarj], but with different design choices and
thus trade-offs. See @cite[language-workbenches-survey] for a detailed survey
of the characteristics and design choices in a large sample of workbenches.
